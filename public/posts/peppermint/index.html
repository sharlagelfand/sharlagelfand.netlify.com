    <p>ðŸ‘‹</p>
<p>A few weeks ago I went to <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/conference/">rstudio::conf()</a> and came home <a href="https://twitter.com/sharlagelfand/status/820704143555727360">sans wallet</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/sharlagelfand/status/820793407966564353">sans keys</a>, but plus a lot of inspiration to actually work on personal projects and try out some of the new (and not-so-new!) things that RStudio has to offer. Iâ€™d touched Shiny a few times but honestly maybe hadnâ€™t used RMarkdown since the Sweave days. Combine this with listening religiously to <a href="https://soundcloud.com/nssd-podcast">Not So Standard Deviations</a> and getting the brilliant idea from Hilary to do my personal finances in R, and I had a project!</p>
<p>I find my finances to be awkward and hard to coordinate. Previously I used a mix of Mint.and, for a while, a spreadsheet that looked something like this:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/images/2017-01-31-Peppermint/budget.png" />

</div>
<p>(what did I do if I had more transactions than the number of provided lines? Â¯\(ãƒ„)/Â¯)</p>
<p>but neither were really ideal! Mint isnâ€™t designed for the way Canadian bank accounts work (or maybe I donâ€™t have adult enough banking for how Mint works), but Iâ€™d been finding it really hard to keep track of my spending, and <em>especially</em> my savingsâ€¦ without it looking like I was spending that money instead of saving it.</p>
<p>Introducingâ€¦<a href="https://sharlagelfand.shinyapps.io/peppermint/">Peppermint</a>!</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/images/2017-01-31-Peppermint/peppermint.png" />

</div>
<p><br> Peppermint is a hilariously named personal finance app that reads from a bunch of google sheets and creates summaries + visualizations based on what I wanted to see most:</p>
<ul>
<li>the current monthâ€™s spending, in categories ($ amount, as well as % of my income), and compared to a set budget</li>
<li>itemized list of the current monthâ€™s spending</li>
<li>spending over time</li>
<li>the current monthâ€™s savings, based on a set goal</li>
<li>savings over time</li>
</ul>
<p>You can go into the <a href="https://sharlagelfand.shinyapps.io/peppermint/">app</a> and click around (thereâ€™s a tab!), and all of the code is available <a href="https://sharlagelfand.shinyapps.io/peppermint/">on github</a>.</p>
<p>Since personal finance is personal: Iâ€™ve gone to some efforts to anonymize the data â€“ pretty much everything is multiplied by a random number between 0.1 and 5, and all descriptions for my transactions (i.e., where I shop) are replaced with random strings. The categories are unchanged, but some runs itâ€™ll look like I spend 0.4% of my monthly income on $3,000 worth of rent and aim to save $200. So yes, the numbers you see up there are a lie! My car insurance is overpriced, but not $1,200 a month overpriced.</p>
<p>Initially I was manually exporting my transaction data from Mint but knew that wouldnâ€™t last - I did look into a <a href="https://github.com/mrooney/mintapi">Python API</a> that seemed pretty good (in theory) but figuring out cookies and credentials to get from Chrome was beyond the scope of my MVP (aaand I didnâ€™t want to write Python).</p>
<p>So now, everything is in a bunch of google sheets that I update manually - I think this is good for me. It helps me actually look at what Iâ€™m spending ðŸ’° on, and <em>especially</em> cash transactions, whichâ€¦ if you see the personal version of my app, youâ€™ll see I have no idea what I spend that cash on at all. Feeling optimized, and at least thereâ€™s no more of this:</p>

</div>
<p>ps: I would be remiss if I didnâ€™t shout out Kathyrn Morrison, who also picked up Hilaryâ€™s idea and did a <a href="https://kathryntmorrison.github.io/R_money">great post</a> on managing her personal finances in R!</p>
<p>Some things I learned along the way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shiny vs shinydashboard vs flexdashboard â€“ yeah, I wasnâ€™t too sure either! I found <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37992147/r-shiny-which-hammer-straight-shiny-flexdashboard-or-shinydashboard">this StackOverflow</a> post which is a great explanation of the difference, and eventually settled on flexdashboard for this project, primarly because I didnâ€™t need a ton of/any interactivity. Future iterations TBD.</li>
<li><code>Sys.time()</code> is timezone dependent (of course), and the timezone that ShinyApps.io is on is not necessarily my timezone â€“ which results in a small window where no data was showing up for the current month because, for me, the current month was January, but in Shiny world, it was February.</li>
<li>How to write my first <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/rsconnect/issues/153">github issue</a>!</li>
<li>If you call Universal Studios enough times (i.e., until they have actually found your wallet), they will <a href="https://twitter.com/sharlagelfand/status/824089175909539840">mail you your wallet</a>!</li>
</ul>
<p>pps: this is my first blog post! some notes on that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Yihui Xieâ€™s <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown">blogdown</a> package is really, really cool. Itâ€™s still in beta without a ton of documentation, and I couldnâ€™t quite figure it out (though Amber Thomasâ€™s <a href="https://proquestionasker.github.io/blog/Making_Site/">post on it</a> is amazing, but Iâ€™m looking forward to trying it out again in the future!</li>
<li>This blog is created using Jekyll. There are a ton of guides to setting up a new site, but I ended up using a process similar to the one outlined <a href="https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/">here</a> by forking and changing an existing theme.</li>
</ul>
