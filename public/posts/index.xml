      <description>According to the 2017 Open Cities Index Results, the city of Toronto ranks second in Canada in terms of open data maturity. With 250+ data sets, this initiative makes it easy to access information on business, culture, environment, finance, health, parks + rec, public safety, transportation, and more.
I was curious to poke around open data and learn something new along the way, both in terms of Toronto and the R ecosystem.</description>

      <description>As you may know, I like astrology. Astro Poets is a great twitter account run by two poets who post painfully accurate descriptions and commentary on the twelve zodiac signs.
Today they tweeted that a Viirgo wrote in asking if people like tweets about Virgos more.
Now, Iâ€™m not a Virgo, and they definitely made fun of the person for asking â€“ but now I gotta know.</description>

      <title>Tidy Text Mining with Horoscopes</title>

      <description>If youâ€™ve ever talked to me for ~10 seconds, chances are Iâ€™m wondering what your zodiac sign is â€“ any longer than that, Iâ€™ve probably asked you.
Astrology is not for everyone, but itâ€™s definitely for me! YMMV on different sites, and horoscope quality definitely varies, but Iâ€™ve found an astrologer that Iâ€™m a pretty big fan of â€“ Chani Nicholas!</description>

      <description>ðŸ‘‹
A few weeks ago I went to rstudio::conf() and came home sans wallet, sans keys, but plus a lot of inspiration to actually work on personal projects and try out some of the new (and not-so-new!) things that RStudio has to offer. Iâ€™d touched Shiny a few times but honestly maybe hadnâ€™t used RMarkdown since the Sweave days.</description>
