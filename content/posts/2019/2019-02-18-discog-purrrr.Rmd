For February's #mememe2019 post, I thought it's be fun to look at my music collection. I painstakingly found the correct versions of all my records and tapes and entered them into [discogs](https://www.discogs.com/), *the* music database, for analysis.

There is a discogs API, and an R package for it, too! The [`discogger` package](https://github.com/ewenme/discogger) is created by [Ewen lastnameunknown](https://twitter.com/ewen_) and provides a way to query your discogs collection via R.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(discogger)
library(dplyr)
library(conflicted)

conflict_prefer("filter", "dplyr")
```

I'm querying my collection (you can see it [here](https://www.discogs.com/user/sharlagelfand/collection)), and only keeping the `content` bit.

```{r, cache=TRUE}
my_collection <- discogs_user_collection(user_name = "sharlagelfand")[["content"]]
```

The result of the API call is a deeply nested list, starting with a list for each item in my collection (157 listed). Each of those lists then contains the data: `instance_id`, `rating`, `basic_information`, `folder_id`, `date_added`, and `id`. 

We can look at this using `str()`:

```{r}
my_collection %>%
  head(2) %>%
  str(max.level = 2)
```

Or we can look at some diagrams that I created to help me understand lists.

In all of the diagrams in this post, squares represent lists, with varying degrees of white -> yellow -> orange -> red signifying the list depth, while the pill-shapes represent vectors. The pills are green, but if we run into any colour-blind issues: 1) my apologies, and 2) the shapes will always remain the same. They were all made using [LucidChart](https://www.lucidchart.com/).

Whether we look at the `str()` output or the diagram, we can see that `basic_information` is a list itself! This is just the beginning `r emo::ji("smiling_imp")`

Once we look at `basic_information`, we can see that it *also* contains a number of lists that go quite deep. Given the data, this nesting is not that surprising; a release can be on multiple labels and come from multiple artists. It does make it fun to work with, though! `r emo::ji("upside_down_face")`

![](/images/discogger-purrr/basic_information_list.png){width=65%}

```{r}
my_collection[[1]][["basic_information"]] %>%
  str()
```

For me, the first step is to extract the `basic_information` part only, and transpose it. `purrr:transpose()` "turns a list-of lists 'inside-out.'" I want to turn the list inside-out so that it starts to look more like a data frame, with a list of *variables* rather than a list of *records* (like, observations -- not `r emo::ji("cd")`).

```{r}
library(purrr)

basic_information <- my_collection %>%
  map("basic_information") %>%
  transpose()
```

Once we do that, the list looks totally different. Now we have a list that contains the *variables* from `basic_information`, and *each of those* is a list with 157 elements (lists) in them.

```{r}
basic_information %>%
  str(max.level = 1)
```

So,

1. Yes, this diagram is massive.
2. No, the exact data is not always the same from diagram to diagram `r emo::ji("information_desk_person")`
3. An empty list means there is no data. Some variables have missing data, e.g. sometimes there isn't `text` in `formats`. Sometimes `master_url` is missing, etc.

Now I have a wayyy better idea of what all that ugly `str()` output (omitted here) means. The deep nesting in `descriptions` is horrifying, but I'm confident in my ability to do it `r emo::ji("muscle")`.

The next step is to make that list into a tibble, and only keep the variables I care about. Once we do that, it's a little less hectic to look at.

```{r}
basic_information_tibble <- basic_information %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  select(id, title, artists, formats)

head(basic_information_tibble)
```

Did somebody say list-cols? `r emo::ji("yum")`

![](/images/discogger-purrr/basic_information_tibble.png){width=80%}

The easiest thing to tackle next are the `id` and `title` columns. Every release has only one of each, so we can unlist these and turn the columns into... non-list-cols? reg-cols.

```{r}
basic_information_id_title_unlist <- basic_information_tibble %>% 
  mutate_at(vars(id, title), unlist)

head(basic_information_id_title_unlist)
```

("sorry" about the third item -- it's a [great record!](https://goodthrob.bandcamp.com/album/fuck-off))

I've coloured them in blue now, to indicate they're no longer lists (not differentiating between integer and character, though).

![](/images/discogger-purrr/unlist_id_title.png){width=80%}

To make `artists` workable, I'm transposing it, just like we did with the original list. 

```{r}
basic_information_artists_transpose <- basic_information_id_title_unlist %>%
  mutate(artists = map(artists, transpose))

head(basic_information_artists_transpose)
```

It looks a little different in the tibble printing, but tough to tell what's going on. Instead of a list for each artist that contains `name`, `entity_type`, etc, now *each of those* are lists that contain information on each artist.

So, if there are two artists on a release, their names will both appear under `name`, rather than having a list for each, and each with a `name` element.

![](/images/discogger-purrr/transpose_artists.png){width=80%}

The last column to work with is `formats`, arguably the ugliest one! I actually *don't* want to transpose it, because `descriptions` is already in the format we want. If we transpose it, then it'll turn *that* inside out, which is... not good. Believe me, I spent a while playing with it before I realized what was happening `r emo::ji("see_no_evil")`.

We want to *unlist* `formats`, just like we did for `id` and `title`. The only difference is that we just want to remove the *first* listing hierarchy, so we'll set `recursive = FALSE`.

The reason that we can do this to `formats` is because it's unnecessarily nested. Unlike `artists`, there are no cases where there's more than one format attached to a release, so the nested list isn't necessary.

```{r}
basic_information_formats_unlist <- basic_information_artists_transpose %>%
  mutate(formats = unlist(formats, recursive = FALSE))

head(basic_information_formats_unlist)
```

But just like for `artists`, now the actual elements are at the top level of the list, rather than being buried.

![](/images/discogger-purrr/unlist_formats.png){width=80%}

You thought we were done?! Ha! We still need to get information *out* of `artists` and `formats`.

I want to get the `id` from `artists` so that (eventually), I can use the API again to get *even more* information about the artist.

```{r}
basic_information_tidying <- basic_information_formats_unlist %>%
  mutate(artists_id = map(artists, "id")) %>%
  select(-artists)

basic_information_tidying %>%
  head()
```

But this isn't quite it. `artists_id` is still a list of lists.

```{r}
basic_information_tidying <- basic_information_tidying %>%
  mutate(artists_id = map(artists_id, unlist))

head(basic_information_tidying)
```

Now it's a list of integer vectors. This is, I think, the kind of "list-col" that I'm more familiar with. This is the lego-game-of-thrones-horse-on-a-balcony kind of list-col.

I've tried to illustrate the difference here. The little circles mean it's a character vector with two elements.

![](/images/discogger-purrr/map_artist_id.png){width=80%}

I also want the `name` and `descriptions` bits from `formats`. 

`name` is really easy because it's just a character vector, and never contains multiple elements.

```{r}
basic_information_tidying <- basic_information_tidying %>%
  mutate(format_name = map_chr(formats, "name"))

head(basic_information_tidying)
```

![](/images/discogger-purrr/map_format_name.png){width=55%}

Finally, `descriptions`, for all the headache it's been, is the exact same to extract as `artists_id`. I've set `.default = FALSE` in case any are missing. `NA`s are a lot easier to work with than `NULL`s later on (endless thank you to Jenny Bryan, not only for absolutely everything I know about lists and purrr, but for telling me about this argument).

```{r}
basic_information_tidying <- basic_information_tidying %>%
  mutate(format_description = map(formats, "descriptions", .default = NA),
         format_description = map(format_description, unlist))
```

![](/images/discogger-purrr/map_format_description.png){width=85%}

With a little renaming and reordering, our final dataset looks like this:

```{r}
basic_information_tidy <- basic_information_tidying %>%
    select(release_id = id, title, artists_id, format_description, format_name)

head(basic_information_tidy)
```

What are we going to do with it? That's a topic for another post `r emo::ji("wave")`.
