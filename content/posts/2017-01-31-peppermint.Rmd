A few weeks ago I went to
[rstudio::conf()](https://www.rstudio.com/conference/) and came home
[sans
wallet](https://twitter.com/sharlagelfand/status/820704143555727360),
[sans
keys](https://twitter.com/sharlagelfand/status/820793407966564353), but
plus a lot of inspiration to actually work on personal projects and try
out some of the new (and not-so-new!) things that RStudio has to offer.
I'd touched Shiny a few times but honestly maybe hadn't used RMarkdown
since the Sweave days. Combine this with listening religiously to [Not
So Standard Deviations](https://soundcloud.com/nssd-podcast) and getting
the brilliant idea from Hilary to do my personal finances in R, and I
had a project!

I find my finances to be awkward and hard to coordinate. Previously I
used a mix of Mint.and, for a while, a spreadsheet that looked something
like this:

(what did I do if I had more transactions than the number of provided
lines? Â¯\\(ãƒ„)/Â¯)

but neither were really ideal! Mint isn't designed for the way Canadian
bank accounts work (or maybe I don't have adult enough banking for how
Mint works), but I'd been finding it really hard to keep track of my
spending, and *especially* my savings... without it looking like I was
spending that money instead of saving it.

Introducing...[Peppermint](https://sharlagelfand.shinyapps.io/peppermint/)!

<br> Peppermint is a hilariously named personal finance app that reads
from a bunch of google sheets and creates summaries + visualizations
based on what I wanted to see most:

-   the current month's spending, in categories ($ amount, as well as %
    of my income), and compared to a set budget
-   itemized list of the current month's spending
-   spending over time
-   the current month's savings, based on a set goal
-   savings over time

You can go into the
[app](https://sharlagelfand.shinyapps.io/peppermint/) and click around
(there's a tab!), and all of the code is available [on
github](https://sharlagelfand.shinyapps.io/peppermint/).

Since personal finance is personal: I've gone to some efforts to
anonymize the data -- pretty much everything is multiplied by a random
number between 0.1 and 5, and all descriptions for my transactions
(i.e., where I shop) are replaced with random strings. The categories
are unchanged, but some runs it'll look like I spend 0.4% of my monthly
income on $3,000 worth of rent and aim to save $200. So yes, the numbers
you see up there are a lie! My car insurance is overpriced, but not
$1,200 a month overpriced.

Initially I was manually exporting my transaction data from Mint but
knew that wouldn't last - I did look into a [Python
API](https://github.com/mrooney/mintapi) that seemed pretty good (in
theory) but figuring out cookies and credentials to get from Chrome was
beyond the scope of my MVP (aaand I didn't want to write Python).  

So now, everything is in a bunch of google sheets that I update manually -
I think this is good for me. It helps me actually look at what I'm
spending ðŸ’° on, and *especially* cash transactions, which... if you see
the personal version of my app, you'll see I have no idea what I spend
that cash on at all. Feeling optimized, and at least there's no more of this:

ps: I would be remiss if I didn't shout out Kathyrn Morrison, who also
picked up Hilary's idea and did a [great
post](https://kathryntmorrison.github.io/R_money) on managing her
personal finances in R!

Some things I learned along the way:

-   Shiny vs shinydashboard vs flexdashboard -- yeah, I wasn't too sure
    either! I found [this
    StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37992147/r-shiny-which-hammer-straight-shiny-flexdashboard-or-shinydashboard)
    post which is a great explanation of the difference, and eventually
    settled on flexdashboard for this project, primarly because I didn't
    need a ton of/any interactivity. Future iterations TBD.
-   `Sys.time()` is timezone dependent (of course), and the timezone
    that ShinyApps.io is on is not necessarily my timezone -- which
    results in a small window where no data was showing up for the
    current month because, for me, the current month was January, but in
    Shiny world, it was February.
-   How to write my first [github
    issue](https://github.com/rstudio/rsconnect/issues/153)!
-   If you call Universal Studios enough times (i.e., until they have
    actually found your wallet), they will [mail you your
    wallet](https://twitter.com/sharlagelfand/status/824089175909539840)!

pps: this is my first blog post! some notes on that:

-   Yihui Xie's [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package
    is really, really cool. It's still in beta without a ton of
    documentation, and I couldn't quite figure it out (though Amber
    Thomas's [post on
    it](https://proquestionasker.github.io/blog/Making_Site/) is
    amazing, but I'm looking forward to trying it out again in the
    future!
-   This blog is created using Jekyll. There are a ton of guides to
    setting up a new site, but I ended up using a process similar to the
    one outlined
    [here](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/)
    by forking and changing an existing theme.
